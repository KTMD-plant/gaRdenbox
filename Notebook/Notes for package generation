notes on package creation.

1.Add features to the description file through usethis:: 
for example:

usethis::use_package("dplyr")

This does not break the description file like manual edditing might.


2. to update documentation file run 
library(roxygen2); # Read in the roxygen2 R package
roxygenise();      # Builds the help files
